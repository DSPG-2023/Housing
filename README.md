## About the Project

In rural Midwestern communities, the presence of high-quality and affordable housing plays a crucial role in preserving a good quality of life and fostering the vitality of the region, particularly for individuals involved in agriculture. However, measuring the condition of housing in rural communities can be a complex and subjective task. To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven approach that can provide a more accurate and objective evaluation of housing quality, identify financing gaps, and optimize the allocation of local, state, and federal funds to maximize community benefits.

Utilizing web scraping techniques to collect images of houses from various assessor websites, an AI model can be developed to analyze and categorize housing features into good or poor quality. This can enable targeted investment strategies. It allows for the identification of houses in need of improvement and determines the areas where financial resources should be directed. By leveraging AI technology in this manner, the project seeks to streamline the housing evaluation process, eliminate subjective biases, and facilitate informed decision-making for housing investment and development initiatives in rural communities.

The goal of the project is to investigate the condition of existing housing stock in rural Midwestern communities and develop a thorough and objective evaluation of housing quality using AI.
