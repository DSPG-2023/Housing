## Demographic Analysis

### Profiling Using R Studio

We constructed a demographic profile of the three WINVEST cities - Grundy Center, Independence, and New Hampton - using R Studio. A demographic profile is a type of demographic analysis that focuses on a specific area. They are built using demographic data. Demographic data are data on **age**, **race**, **ethnicity**, **gender**, **marital status**, **income**, **education**, and **employment**.

The following demographic data were used for the demographic profile of the communities:

-   Population

-   Median income

-   Median home value

-   Median year home built

-   Home ownership rates

We chose these demographic data to give a well-rounded analysis of the housing demographics in our chosen communities and add context to the housing conditions we gathered.

Our data came from the **United States Decennial Census** and the **American Community Survey (ACS)**. The U.S. census is one of the best places to gather demographic data because it counts every resident in the United States. It has a very low inaccuracy, but the U.S. census is only conducted every ten years. The American Community Survey (ACS) is your best bet for more recent data. The ACS has more detailed demographic data and is conducted every five years for the entirety of the United States and every year for places with a population over 65,000. The ACS does not count every individual resident in the United States and instead relies on surveying a proportion of the population to create estimates of the demographics. Thus, it can be inaccurate and provides a margin of error. It is best used for data on the changing population, housing, and workforce.

To collect data in R Studio, we installed the *Tidyverse* and *Tidycensus* packages and loaded them with the `library()` function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse") 
install.packages("tidycensus")
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(tidycensus)
```

The *Tidyverse* package includes a range of functions that make coding in R Studio more user-friendly. It is not necessary for data collection, but it certainly does help. In contrast, the *Tidycensus* package is essential to data collection. The *Tidycensus* package lets you pull data directly from the Decennial Census and the ACS using the `get_decennial()` and `get_acs()` functions. You only need to specify three arguments to pull data: geography, year, and variable.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
get_decennial(geography = "state",
              variable = "P001001",
              year = 2010)  

get_acs(geography = "region",
        variable = "B19013_001",
        year = 2010)
```

To visualize data in R Studio, we installed and loaded more packages: *ggplot2, scales,* and *ggthemes.*

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2") 
install.packages("scales") 
install.packages("ggthemes")
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2) 
library(scales) 
library(ggthemes)
```

*The ggplot2* package is required to create a plot in R Studio. With *ggplot2* you get access to the function `ggplot(),` which allows you to create visualizations. `ggplot()` takes the arguments `data` and `mapping` to create a plot. `Mapping` refers to the x and y coordinates of our data. There are various geoms included in the *ggplot2* package that aid in creating a visualization. Here are some examples:

| Geom             | Result       |
|------------------|--------------|
| geom_line()      | line graph   |
| geom_point()     | scatter plot |
| geom_histogram() | histogram    |
| geom_bar()       | bar chart    |
| geom_col()       | column chart |

Using the packages above, the following plots were made in R Studio. For an example of how the demographic profile can be used, let's analyze Grundy Center. Mentioned above, Grundy Center has the lowest housing conditions of our three cities.

Grundy Center has a percent population change of 7.70%, which is right alongside the percent population change of the state of Iowa and the Midwest. Interestingly, New Hampton has a negative percent change, and Independence has a fairly stable population change. The growth rate of Grundy Center is not reflected in its housing quality.

The population projection plot shows Grundy Center is the smallest of our three communities. Its size may explain the housing quality issue. Smaller communities usually have a smaller tax base and less money to fund neighborhood improvements.

![](/images/demographics/home_ownership.png)

Grundy Center has a much higher home ownership rate than either New Hampton or Independence, which has been consistently higher for the past five years. Grundy Center's home ownership rate has been higher than all three contextual areas -- Iowa, the Midwest, and the United States- for our collected data. Home ownership rates are not reflected in housing quality.

Unlike New Hampton and Independence, Grundy Center's median income is on par with its contextual areas. The median income surpassed the national median in 2019 and has stayed higher. Income is not a problem in Grundy Center.

![](/images/demographics/median_value.png)

Grundy Center's median home value has wavered over the years. In 2009, Grundy Center had the lowest median home value of our communities. It has since risen to have the highest median home value. The median home value is significantly lower for all three communities than the contextual areas.

The houses in our three communities are aged compared to the contextual areas. Iowa has a high percentage of older houses, and this shows in our communities. Grundy Center has the youngest houses and even has a house or two built in 2020 or later. All three cities are missing the increase of houses built from 2010 to 2019, but Grundy Center has the largest percentage of houses built in that time frame.

Grundy Center is close to the Cedar Falls-Waterloo metropolitan area, which could explain the low housing quality and high growth rate, median income, and housing value. There may be demand for housing in the community, and residents may be traveling outside the city for work.

**Other Visualizations**

Using the Infographics feature on ArcGIS Pro, we also created community summaries of Grundy Center, Independence, and New Hampton. These visualizations are a way that communities can gather demographic data quickly and efficiently themselves. The community summary is a base template, but custom demographics can be used.

### Collecting Data to Identify Study Communities

To keep this project moving into other years, we decided to identify study communities in Iowa that could benefit from this project. All data collection was completed in R Studio using the Tidycensus and Tidyverse packages to pull data from the Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS).

The following demographic data was collected:

-   **Age**

    The age of a community's population can tell its growth. Communities with a higher percentage of their population over the age of sixty-five than those under eighteen could have issues with the younger generations moving away. A high median age could indicate the same issue.

-   **Population size**

    Specifically, we were looking for communities between 500 and 10,000. Communities with smaller populations are this project's main focus. We were particularly interested in any communities with a declining population, as that indicates it is struggling.

-   **Housing**

    A low median house value and high median house age can indicate a struggling community. A high median house age can reveal that new housing is not being built in the community and the community is not growing.

-   **Occupancy rates**

    Communities with low home ownership and high vacancy rates could have issues and need help. There is little room for community investment if residents cannot afford to buy their own homes.

-   **Income**

    A low median income or a low percent change in income can indicate a struggling community. There is little room for community investment when residents have little income.

-   **Jobs and employment**

    Employment statistics are important because there will only be money to invest in a community if people are employed. The percentage of the workforce that commuted to work gives information on where jobs are located. If people are commuting, there are not enough jobs in town. People also tend to move to where jobs are.

We started the visualization process in Tableau for the population data. From this visualization, we can pinpoint Iowa communities with a concerning growth rate and population size.

![](images/Percent_Population_Change_by_Population_Size-04.png){fig-align="center"}

The plot above is filtered to only show communities in Iowa with a population between 500 and 10,000. The communities that fall below average for percent population change and population size are potential study communities for our project. Further analysis of the other demographic data is required because many communities fall into this category, but this is a good start.
