# I realized empty folders don't show up in github i just have house_i folders

This folder is meant to be used to show a general idea of how the AI models are preforming. Each house represents what would be an address. So for example house_1 could represent 123 main st. Our test case for 123 main st is whether there is a house present in the image. I do not care if the images in the house_1 folder are the same house because we are simply testing the model. 

Let's say I want two images for this test case, I can find any two images on the internet as long as one image has a house visible and one does not (whether the house is blurred, obstructed, or it is an image of something else). It's probably wise not to use images used for training the models and instead to search for images in the image folders that were downloaded from somewhere. 

Below I list the test cases I came up with for house 1-13. If you make more test cases please add them to the list below so others can easily find which house is which test case. Some test cases may need multiple versions to properly test how well the models are preforming.

House 1; number of pictures = 1; [image of a house with a bad gutter]; model we are testing = gutter

H2; #P=3; [Clear Image], [Partially Obstructed image(mostly see house with a minor block such as tree or electric post)], [Poorly Obstructed image(barely see house in image)]; house_present

H3; #P=2; [Good Image], [Good Image]; random function

H4; #P=1; [Overgrown bushes]; vegetation

H5; #P=1; [chipped paint on house]; siding

H6; #P=1; [poor siding (broken panels or holes)]; siding

H7; #P=2; [one house visible], [multiple houses visible]; multi house

H8; #P=1; [Good Image]; overall program

H9; #P=1; [No house in image]; house present

H10; #P=2; [good image], [no house in image]; house present

H11; #P=1; [old roof (faded maybe)]; roof

H12; #P=1; [new roof]; roof

H13; #P=1; [damaged roof]; roof
